## About

CodinGame is a platform that offers fun and challenging programming problems for developers to improve their skills. The challenges range from easy to very difficult, often requiring optimization and creative problem-solving techniques. This repository showcases the solutions I’ve implemented for various problems, and each solution reflects my approach to solving real-world algorithmic challenges.

## Solutions

Below are some of the problems I’ve solved with links to each specific solution:

1. **[Problem Name 1](link-to-solution-1)** - Description of the problem and the approach I used.
2. **[Problem Name 2](link-to-solution-2)** - Description of the problem and the approach I used.
3. **[Problem Name 3](link-to-solution-3)** - Description of the problem and the approach I used.

Each solution is accompanied by a detailed explanation of the approach, the algorithm used, and a breakdown of the code.

## Languages Used

- **C/C++**: Many of the challenges require fast performance, and I often use C/C++ for this purpose.
- **Python**: For simpler problems and when rapid development is needed.
- **JavaScript**: Used for solving some problems with a focus on web-related challenges or algorithm exploration.
